# Week 2 {#ch:Workshop2}

## Preliminary infomation {#sec:Prelim2}

Previously we have learnt about both units and rearranging equations, and in this material we will learn about how these apply to powers, exponents and logarithms. 

The exponential function '$\textrm{e}$, and its reciprical function, the natural log $\ln$ appear a lot in the natural world, and so appear a lot in chemistry. Kinetics, thermodynamics, and even spectroscopy have examples of exponential decay ($1/e$), and so both exponential functions and logs need to be confidently handled.

Powers (such as squares, cubes and even square roots) also appear frequently in chemistry and the rules for manipulating all of these mathematical functions are similar.

### Rules of powers and exponents {#sec:rulespowers}

Powers and exponentials share a common from, in both cases there is a base (b), raised to a power (p), equation \@ref(eq:powers).

\begin{equation}
b^a
(\#eq:powers)
\end{equation}

- in a power function the base (b) varies as the power (p) is fixed, for example:
    + $c_{p,n} = aT^3$
    + $E=mc^2$
    + $\frac{\textrm{d}[A]}{\textrm{d}t}=-k[A]^2$
- in an exponential function the power (p) varies and the base (b) is fixed, for example:
    + $[\textrm{H}^+]=10^{-p\textrm{H}}$
    + $[A]=[A]_0\textrm{e}^{-kt}$
- negative powers are equivalent to one over the equivalent positive power. So:
    + $\textrm{e}^{-x}= 1/\textrm{e}^{x}$
    + $x^2 = 1 / x^{-2}$



When things have a common base then there are 'rules' on how to combine powers. We have essentially been using some of these rules already when we have considered units.


<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">

<span style="color: black;">When multiplying two things which share a common base, you add the powers:

\begin{equation}
\color{black}
{m^a \times m^b = m^{a+b}}
(\#eq:combpowermult)
\end{equation}

<div style="height: 1px; background-color: #9FC2D3"></div>

<span style="color: black;">When dividing two things that share a common base, you subtract the denominator power from the numerator power:

\begin{equation}
\color{black}
{\frac{p^a}{p^b} = p^{a - b}}
(\#eq:combpowerdiv)
\end{equation}

<div style="height: 1px; background-color: #9FC2D3"></div>

<span style="color: black;">When raising something with a power to a further power, then the two powers are multiplied:

\begin{equation}
\color{black}
{\left(q^a\right)^b =  q^{a\times b}}
(\#eq:combpowerraise)
\end{equation}


</div>

There are a few other rules to help us understand how to manipulate powers:

<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
<span style="color: black;">*Anything* raised to the power 0 is equal to 1:

\begin{equation*}
\color{black}{x^0=1}
\end{equation*}

<span style="color: black;">or:

\begin{equation*}
\color{black}{\textrm{e}^0=1}
\end{equation*}

<div style="height: 1px; background-color: #9FC2D3"></div>

<span style="color: black;">Roots may be expressed as fractional powers:

\begin{equation}
\color{black}
{\sqrt[n]{x}=x^{\frac{1}{n}}}
(\#eq:fracpower)
\end{equation}

<div style="height: 1px; background-color: #9FC2D3"></div>

<span style="color: black;">When we see negative powers it is the same as the inverser of the positive power.

\begin{equation}
\color{black}
{x^{-n}={\frac{1}{x^n}}}
(\#eq:negpower)
\end{equation}
</span>
</div>


### Rules of logs {#sec:rulelog}

Logs are the inverse function of exponents, and can have many bases:

When we use 'natural logs' we use the terminology $\ln$, a natural log is the inverse of '$e$'.

\begin{equation}
\color{black}
{x = \ln e^x}
(\#eq:natlog)
\end{equation}

Other logs are ususally marked with the *base*, however if no base is indicated it should be considered that this is $\log_{10}$.

\begin{equation}
\color{black}
{x = \log_{10} 10^x}
(\#eq:10log)
\end{equation}

Just as with combining functions with powers there are a number of rules which help us handle and manipulate logs, these rules are the same no matter the base of the log. When combining logs (these rules are the same regardless of base).

<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">

<span style="color: black;">
<span style="color: black;">For adding to logarithms of the same base:

\begin{equation}
\color{black}
{\log_x A + \log_x B = \log_x (AB)}
(\#eq:logadd)
\end{equation}

<div style="height: 1px; background-color: #9FC2D3"></div>
<span style="color: black;">When subtracting two logarithms of the same base:

\begin{equation}
\color{black}
{\log_x A  - \log_x B = \log_x \left(\frac{A}{B}\right)}
(\#eq:logsub)
\end{equation}

<div style="height: 1px; background-color: #9FC2D3"></div>

<span style="color: black;">When taking a logarithm of something raised to a power:

\begin{equation}
\color{black}
{\log_x (A^n)= n \log_x A}
(\#eq:logpower)
\end{equation}
</span>
</div>

There are occassions where we need to change the base of a log, this for example occurs in the derivation of the Beer-Lambert law where we look at the $\log_{10}$ of the ratio of light intensity, but this comes from a exponential decay of light intensity through the sample $\ln$.

If we want to change the bases of logs (such as in the Beer-Lambert law), there is one final rule of logs.


<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
<span style="color: black;">When changing the base of a logarithm:

\begin{equation}
\color{black}
{log_b A = \frac{\log_x A}{\log_x b}}
(\#eq:convpower)
\end{equation}
</span>
</div>


### Relationship between logs and exponents

As we have seen previously every function has an inverse function, a function that we can use to 'undo' an action. For addition this inverse function is subtraction, for multiplication, division. In the case of exponents the inverse function is a logarithm (to the same base), and reciprically, the inverse function of a log is an exponential.

We will use this later in the course when we look at generating linear $y=mx+c$ plots (Week \@ref(ch:Workshop3)), because exponetial functions are curved when plotted, and so many graphs which are plotted in chemistry have a $\ln$ of a function on the $y$ axis.

### A note on logs, exponentials and units

You cannot take a log of anything with a unit, nor can you take a exponent of anything with a unit, mathematically it makes no sense. However this helps us with our rearrangements



## Examples {#sec:examples2}

The wavenumber of an *infra*-red vibration within a molecule is linked to the bond strength, $k$ and the reduced mass $\mu$ of the atoms in the bond, Equation \@ref(eq:bondvib):

<div class="alert alert-light" role="alert">
\begin{equation}
