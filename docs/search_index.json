Unfortunately both of these things result in lost marks for a number of candidates either because of carelessness or lack of understanding. Bad habits in rearranging equations, such as trying to undertake too many steps at once often lead to error, mantras such as ‘change the side change the sign’ are often an oversimplification and may lead to error. Values have to have units, without them things make no sense, and in science we cannot assume units on context. Converting between units is equally important and famously errors can occur. You should ‘work out’ your unit in every case, not just assume it is something and writing that down. In short, show your working clearly, if you do so you will make fewer mistakes. Paper doesn’t cost much, and if you write on a tablet each new page is free so please space out your work, when learning things annotate your work with useful things (this will help you revise), and make it clear! 1.1.1 Rearranging equations ‘Change the side change the sign’ is often running through peoples’ heads as they rearrange equations, however it is only of limited utility as it makes no sense when considering logs or exponentials. More correctly we should think about using reciprical functions on both sides of an equation, for example if I multiply both sides of an equation by the same thing it is mathematically equivalent of doing nothing. This subtle distinction would ‘fix’ almost all of the common errors seen in chemistry. If we start with one of the most important equations in chemistry, the Gibbs’ equation: \\[\\begin{equation*} \\Delta G = \\Delta H - T \\Delta S \\end{equation*}\\] Here the capital ‘delta’ (\\(\\Delta\\)) in each case means ‘large change in’ and so they cannot be canceled. If I wanted to rearrange this equation to make \\(\\Delta S\\), the entropy change, the subject then: Start by adding \\(T\\Delta S\\) to both sides of the equation: \\[\\begin{equation*} \\Delta G + T \\Delta S= \\Delta H - T \\Delta S + T \\Delta S \\end{equation*}\\] on the right hand side \\(- T \\Delta S + T \\Delta S=0\\) and so cancel. We can then subtract \\(\\Delta G\\) from both sides of the equation: \\[\\begin{equation*} \\Delta G + T \\Delta S -\\Delta G = \\Delta H -\\Delta G \\end{equation*}\\] now the \\(\\Delta G -\\Delta G\\) on the left hand side of the equation cancel, leaving us with: \\[\\begin{equation*} T \\Delta S = \\Delta H -\\Delta G \\end{equation*}\\] Now to cancel the ‘T’ on the left hand side we need to divide by ‘\\(T\\)’ on both sides: \\[\\begin{equation*} \\frac{T \\Delta S}{T} = \\frac{\\Delta H -\\Delta G}{T} \\end{equation*}\\] which leaves us with an equation with \\(\\Delta S\\) as the subject: \\[\\begin{equation*} \\Delta S = \\frac{\\Delta H -\\Delta G}{T} \\end{equation*}\\] I recognise as show this is extreamly arduous, however it is changing how we think about the problem which is important. 1.1.2 SI base units Despite cultural tendancies to hold onto older units (such as pounds &amp; ounces, calories, Calories and miles) in science all units are directly derived from the international standard SI system. Althought there have been many versions of metric units over the years it became increasingly important to standardise units. The SI system of base units has seven fundamental units (Table 1.1) from which all other units are derived. Recently there has been interest in finding more fundamental ways to describe each of these units (rather than an actual lump (mass) or bar (length) of platinum) whereby units are described by relation to physical constants (such as the speed of light, or Avagadro’s constant which define the meter and mole respectively). Table 1.1: The seven base units from which all others are dervied. SI base unit symbol quantity symbol (dimension) quantity kilogram kg M mass metre m L length second s T time ampere A I electric current kelvin K Θ temperature mole mol N amount of substance candela cd J luminous intensity 1.1.3 SI Derived units James Clarke Maxwell developed the field of dimensional analysis. Dimensional analysis shows that units have to be consistent in equations. To add to values in an equation they must have the same unit - so I can’t add kJ mol-1 to J K-1 mol-1, nor can I directly add kJ mol-1 to J mol-1. When multiplying or dividing values with units then the units combine (by performing the same operation). Velocity is displacment (in m) divided by time (in s), and so the unit of velocity is m s-1. Some ‘combined units’ have been given their own unique names (Table 1.2), these often make it easier to use the unit (it is a lot easier to say ‘volt’ than kg m2 s-3 A-1 each time you need to use it). The case of these units (just as with the SI base units) is important, however it should be noted when writing the unit name, even if they are named for a person, that name begins with a lower case letter. Table 1.2: Some common named SI derived units used in chemistry. symbol SI derived unit quantity SI base units other SI units Hz hertz frequency s-1 N newton force kg m s-2 Pa pascal pressure kg m-1 s-2 N m-2 J joule energy kg m2 s-2 N m W watt power kg m2 s-3 J s-1 C coulomb electrical charge A s V volt electrical potential kg m2 s-3 A-1 J C-1 F farad electrical capacitance kg-1 m-2 s4 A2 C V-1 Ω ohm electrical resistance kg m2 s-3 A-2 V A-1 S siemens electrical conductance kg-1 m-2 s3 A2 A V-1 or 1/Ω Having said that, Table 1.2 contains some common units used in chemistry the units most used in chemistry for concentration, thermodynamics and kinetics are so far not named for anyone and so are usually written in full form. However mol dm-3 is often shortend to M (for molarity), this is a unit I use a lot and so in many questions you will see concentrations given as (for example) 0.250 mM or 1.000 M (not the longer 0.250 mmol dm-3 or 1.000 mol dm-3). Please note when reporting compound units there should be a space between each unit, so it is J K-1 mol-1 not JK-1mol-1. 1.1.4 Other units and conversion factors There are a number of non-SI base or derived units which are in common usage which are useful to know and be able to convert between. Table 1.3 contains a number of useful unit conversions. Table 1.3: The relationship between some other common units and the SI system. unit quantity SI equivalant torr (or mm Hg) pressure \\(\\frac{101325}{760}\\) Pa atm pressure 101325 Pa bar pressure 100000 Pa eV energy 1.602176634 × 10-19 J cal energy 4.184 J Cal energy 4.184 kJ Å length 1 × 10-10 m There are myriad other units in use, either with historical or geographic preference, or just for niche purposes (where would we be without olympic swimming pools or London buses). Examples such as the mile, furlong or beard-second are all units of length. Further, the unit ºC is formally an SI derived unit. The temperature in kelvin is: \\[\\begin{equation*} T (\\textrm{K}) = T (^\\circ \\textrm{C}) + 273.15 \\end{equation*}\\] Just a note to say that this 273.15 K conversion is ‘precise’ in other words we can consider it to have infinite significant figures, and so if we happen to know temperatures in centigrade to more than two decimal places we do not loose any of these in conversion to kelvin. 1.1.5 SI prefixes and standard form In general lower case prefixes are used for negative powers and upper case prefixes are used for positive powers, however k (kilo) is an obvious exception to this rule. (Other exceptions are da (deca, 101) and h (hecto, 102)). Table 1.4: The more common SI prefixes used in chemistry. SI prefix SI prefix ‘name’ standard form multiplier y yocto 10-24 z zepto 10-21 a atto 10-18 f femto 10-15 p pico 10-12 n nano 10-9 μ micro 10-6 m milli 10-3 c centi 10-2 d deci 10-1 k kilo 103 When prefixes are used there is no space between prefix and unit, (so mm (millimeter) not m m (which could be confused for meter meter)). There can be some confusion with prefixes and inverse units, for example ns-1 is the same unit as 1/ns. This could be more properly written as 109 s-1 (and is not in fact 10-9 s-1). When there are squares (or cubes) combined with prefixes it is a statement that the prefix is squared (or cubed) as well. So for example 1 cm2 is quite literally 1 cm × 1 cm (or 1 × 10-4 m2). 1.2 Examples 1.2.1 Conversion of mL to L or cm3 to dm3 One of the most common conversions undertaken in the physical chemistry lab is conversion of mL to L (or more correctly cm3 to dm3), and although most people are happy to know ‘you just divide by 1000’ most haven’t thought ‘why’, nor does everyone get this unit conversion correct. Both of these examples are shown in a worked video at teh end of this section, as is a pdf of the handwritten notes from this video. 1.2.1.1 Conversion of mL to L We can solve this logially, by first having the assertion that 1 mL = 1 × 10-3 L. Therefore when I want to convert mL to L I just multiply by 1 × 10^-3 (which is equivalent to dividing by 1000), or more formally: 1 mL = 1 × 10-3 L 1 = 1 × 10-3 L mL-1 anything may be multiplied by 1 and there be no change and so if I were to want to convert 27.2 mL to L then: 27.2 mL × 1 × 10-3 L mL-1 we can see that the units of mL and mL-1 cancel and we are left with just L and so: 27.2 mL = 27.2 × 10-3 L Writing this as either 27.2 × 10-3 L or 0.0272 L are both equivalent and both valid. 1.2.1.2 Conversion of cm3 to dm3 It will come as no surprise to know that the same process of either multiplying by 1 × 10-3 or dividing by 1000 will correctly do this conversion, however knowing that can help justify the process here. I am going to start with a similar assertion as above: 1 cm = 1 × 10-2 m and so 1 cm3 = (1 × 10-2)3 m3 = 1 × 10-6 m3 and equivalently 1 dm = 1 × 10-1 m (remember the prefix is raised to the same power as the number) and so: 1 dm3 = (1 × 10-1)3 m3 = 1 × 10-3 m3 for each of these I can make statements where 1 equals something… 1 = 1 × 10-6 m3 cm-3 1 = 1 × 10-3 m3 dm-3 and I can then combine these into a single statement by dividing one by the other: 1 = 1 × 10-6 m3 cm-3 / 1 × 10-3 m3 dm-3 which simplifies (because m3 cancels and so do some of the powers of 10) to : 1 = 1 × 10-3 dm3 cm-3 again if we take the example of 27.2 cm3 (which is the more formal unit of mL) then: 27.2 cm3 = 27.2 cm3 × 1 × 10-3 dm3 cm-3 = 27.2 × 10-3 dm3 Now I have broken both of these down into multiple steps, and it is good to do this until you become more confident in these conversions, but in time you will be able to streamline this process. This video shows me working through both of the above problems: The ‘notes’ from this video may be found here. 1.3 Questions 1.3.1 Rearranging equations Answers for these questions are in Section 1.4.1.

Units should be expressed as “Quantity / unit” to allow you to express them as dimensionless quantities in the table or on the axis of your graph (please note brackets are absolutely incorrect). This is because this is how our governing body (IUPAC) tell us how to do it. See the IUPAC Green Book (2012 edition, page 3). You can think of the horizontal line below the header as an equals sign, so: Table 3.1: The effect of potassium iodide concentration on emission intensity and fluorescence lifetime of acridone in aqueous solution. [KI] / M [KNO2] / M Emission intensity / 103 cps τ / ns 0 1.100 16.580 17.60 0.040 1.060 3.753 3.90 0.100 1.000 1.566 1.80 0.200 0.900 0.721 0.95 0.300 0.800 0.446 0.64 0.500 0.600 0.242 0.39 0.800 0.300 0.121 0.25 in the table above the third value down in the first column can be expressed as: [KI] / M = 0.100 which of course rearranges to: [KI] = 0.100 M. If we look at the top value in the third column: Emission intensity / 103 cps = 16.580 which of course rearranges to: Emission intensity = 16.580 × 103 cps 3.1.2 Plotting of graphs When ever we plot a graph we have to determine what we plot on each of the two axes. The independent variable is the variable we have control over, we plot it (or something related to it) on the x-axis (the horizontal axis). The dependent variable is the varible we measure, we plot it (or something related to it) on the y-axis (the vertical axis). These axis should under most circumstances not contain constants unless those constants are specific to the experiment. There is no need to start a graph axis at zero - you do not need a ‘squiggle’ on the axis to show that it is not starting at zero (that is what the numbers on the axis tell you), this squiggle (or more formally an axis break) does have a job when plotting graphs, but usually the use by first year undergraduates is incorrect. When plotting a graph, we want to have broken down the equation we are using to fit the linear relationship: \\[\\begin{equation} y = mx+c \\tag{3.1} \\end{equation}\\] We should never force a graph through a particular intercept (c). It is important when we ever have performed a calculation to determine values to plot on either x or y axis that we have taken account for any multipliers in the header, and that units ar SI (such as tempeature in K!). A gradient is calculated by determining the change in y divided by the change in x: \\(m= \\frac{\\Delta y}{\\Delta x}\\) Don’t forget units on gradients! The units of a gradient are the units on y divided by the units on x. 3.1.3 Example of plotting graphs The Stern-Volmer (Equation (3.4)) shows how the lifetime \\(\\tau\\) of a dye changes with concentration of a quencher, [Q]. The data in Table 3.1 can be modeled using the Stern-Volmer equation, you will note that this equation uses terms with a subscript 0 (\\(\\tau_0\\)), when values like this are frequently used in chemistry (and physics). \\[\\begin{equation} \\frac{\\tau_0}{\\tau}=1+k[Q] \\tag{3.2} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(k = k_q \\tau_0\\). These ‘subscript 0’ values are referencing values when the independant variable is zero, so \\(\\tau_0\\) = 17.60 ns. You will notice that Equation (3.4) is already arranged into \\(y=mx+c\\), where the x variable is [KI] and the y variable is \\(\\frac{\\tau_0}{\\tau}\\). This means that the gradient is k, and the intercept 1. 3.2 Questions When plotting graphs feel free to plot either by hand, in python, excel or numbers. The choice is entirely up to you. 3.2.1 Sketch graphs Answers for these questions are in Section 3.3.1. For the following equations sketch suitable linear plots indicating values of the intercept and gradient on each sketch. Show how absorption, \\(A\\), changes with concentration, \\(c\\): \\(A = \\varepsilon c l\\) Show how pressure, \\(p\\), changes with temperature, \\(T\\): \\(pV = nRT\\) Show how pressure, \\(p\\), changes with volume, \\(V\\): \\(pV = nRT\\) 3.2.2 Second order kinetics Answers for these questions are in Section 3.3.2. Use the following table of data to plot a graph of \\(\\frac{1}{[A]}\\) against t. Find the gradient and intercept.

This is exactly what partial differentiation does, although it recognises that there may be more than one variable in the system… Partial differentiation uses a different notation to standard differentiation to denote there is more than one variable. Subscritps are used to denote variables which are kept constant. If y is a function of both x and z, then we can differentiate with respect to either variable, in this case we treat the other variable as a constant and differentiate as we ever have. The notation for differentiating y with respect to z as x is kept constant would be: \\[\\begin{equation*} \\left(\\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial z}\\right)_x \\end{equation*}\\] In some circumstances you may wish to differentiate a function first by one variable and then by another, the notation is this case is: \\[\\begin{equation*} \\left(\\frac{\\partial^2 y}{\\partial x \\partial z}\\right) \\end{equation*}\\] this is implying that the partial derivative of y with respect to x was determined first and then the partial derivate of that first derivative was determined with respect to z. It should not matter in which order you perform these functions, they should both yield the same answer. 5.3 Questions 5.3.1 Product rule questions Differentiate the following using the product rule: \\(y = x e^{7x}+ 7xe^x\\) \\(y = 5x \\cos (2x)\\) \\(y = \\frac{\\sin x}{x^2}\\) \\(y = \\tan x\\) 5.3.2 More complex differentiation questions Differentiate the following (you will need to decide if you need the product rule or the chain rule): \\(y = x \\ln x\\) \\(y = \\sin ^7 (5x)+ \\cos ^5 (7x)\\) \\(y = x^2 e^{x^2}\\) \\(y = e^{\\sin x^2}\\) 5.3.3 Partial differentiation questions For the following function determine: \\(\\left(\\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial z}\\right)_x\\), \\(\\left(\\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial x}\\right)_z\\), \\(\\left(\\frac{\\partial^2 y}{\\partial z^2}\\right)_x\\), \\(\\left(\\frac{\\partial^2 y}{\\partial x^z}\\right)_z\\), \\(\\left(\\frac{\\partial^2 y}{\\partial x \\partial z}\\right)\\) and \\(\\left(\\frac{\\partial^2 y}{\\partial z \\partial x}\\right)\\) \\(y = x^6z -3x^2z^3+x^2z+6z^6+5\\) \\(y = e^{3x}+ze^{2x}+x^2e^{-z}-z^2\\) \\(y=\\frac{\\sin (3z)}{x}-\\frac{1}{e^{3x}z^2}\\) \\(y=\\sin(3z^2+2xz+x^2)\\)* *this one is involved - it uses both the chain and the product rule! 5.4 Answers 5.4.1 Product rule questions \\(\\dfrac{\\textrm{d}y}{\\textrm{d}x}=e^{7x}+7xe^{7x}+ 7e^x+7xe^x\\) \\(\\dfrac{\\textrm{d}y}{\\textrm{d}x}=5 \\cos (2x)-10x \\sin (2x)\\) \\(\\dfrac{\\textrm{d}y}{\\textrm{d}x}= \\frac{\\cos x}{x^2}-\\frac{2\\sin x}{x^3}\\) \\(\\dfrac{\\textrm{d}y}{\\textrm{d}x}=\\frac{1}{\\cos^2 x}\\) 5.4.2 More complex differentiation questions \\(\\dfrac{\\textrm{d}y}{\\textrm{d}x}=\\ln x +1\\) \\(\\dfrac{\\textrm{d}y}{\\textrm{d}x}=35 \\cos (5x) \\sin^6 (5x) - 35 \\sin (7x) \\cos^4(7x)\\) \\(\\dfrac{\\textrm{d}y}{\\textrm{d}x}=2x e^{x^2}+ 2x^3e^{x^2}\\) \\(y=2x \\cos x^2 e^{\\sin x^2}\\) 5.4.3 Partial differentiation questions \\(\\left(\\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial z}\\right)_x= x^6-9x^2z^2+x^2+36z^5\\), \\(\\left(\\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial x}\\right)_z=6x^5z-6xz^3+2xz\\), \\(\\left(\\frac{\\partial^2 y}{\\partial z^2}\\right)_x=-18X^2z+180z^4\\), \\(\\left(\\frac{\\partial^2 y}{\\partial x^z}\\right)_z=30x^4z-6z^3\\), \\(\\left(\\frac{\\partial^2 y}{\\partial x \\partial z}\\right)=6x^5-18xz^2+2x\\) and \\(\\left(\\frac{\\partial^2 y}{\\partial z \\partial x}\\right)=6x^5-18xz^2+2x\\) \\(\\left(\\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial z}\\right)_x=e^{2x}-x^2e^{-z}-2z\\), \\(\\left(\\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial x}\\right)_z=3e^{3x}+2e^{2x}z+2xe^{-z}\\), \\(\\left(\\frac{\\partial^2 y}{\\partial z^2}\\right)_x=x^2e^{-z}-2\\), \\(\\left(\\frac{\\partial^2 y}{\\partial x^z}\\right)_z=9e^{3x}+4e^{2x}z+ 2e^{-z}\\), \\(\\left(\\frac{\\partial^2 y}{\\partial x \\partial z}\\right)=2e^{2x}-2xe^{-z}\\) and \\(\\left(\\frac{\\partial^2 y}{\\partial z \\partial x}\\right)=2e^{2x}-2xe^{-z}\\) \\(\\left(\\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial z}\\right)_x=\\frac{\\cos (3z)}{x}+\\frac{2}{e^{3x}z^3}\\), \\(\\left(\\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial x}\\right)_z=-\\frac{\\sin (3z)}{x^2}+\\frac{3}{e^{3x}z^2}\\), \\(\\left(\\frac{\\partial^2 y}{\\partial z^2}\\right)_x=-9\\frac{\\sin (3z)}{x}-\\frac{6}{e^{3x}z^4}\\), \\(\\left(\\frac{\\partial^2 y}{\\partial x^z}\\right)_z=\\frac{2\\sin (3z)}{x^3}-\\frac{9}{e^{3x}z^2}\\), \\(\\left(\\frac{\\partial^2 y}{\\partial x \\partial z}\\right)=\\frac{-3\\cos (3z)}{x^2}-\\frac{6}{e^{3x}z^3}\\) and \\(\\left(\\frac{\\partial^2 y}{\\partial z \\partial x}\\right)=\\frac{-3\\cos (3z)}{x^2}-\\frac{6}{e^{3x}z^3}\\) \\(\\left(\\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial z}\\right)_x=(6z+2x)\\cos(3z^2+2xz+x^2)\\), \\(\\left(\\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial x}\\right)_z=(2z+2x)\\cos(3z^2+2xz+x^2)\\), \\(\\left(\\frac{\\partial^2 y}{\\partial z^2}\\right)_x=2\\cos(3z^2+2xz+x^2)-(2z+2x)^2\\sin(3z^2+2xz+x^2)\\), \\(\\left(\\frac{\\partial^2 y}{\\partial x^z}\\right)_z=6\\cos(3z^2+2xz+x^2)-(6z+2x)^2\\sin(3z^2+2xz+x^2)\\), \\(\\left(\\frac{\\partial^2 y}{\\partial x \\partial z}\\right)=2\\cos(3z^2+2xz+x^2)-(2z+2x)(6z+2x)\\sin(3z^2+2xz+x^2)\\) and \\(\\left(\\frac{\\partial^2 y}{\\partial z \\partial x}\\right)=2\\cos(3z^2+2xz+x^2)-(2z+2x)(6z+2x)\\sin(3z^2+2xz+x^2)\\) if you can do this one you can do them all!!!
