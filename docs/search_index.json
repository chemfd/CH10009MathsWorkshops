However, by providing the notes as a .html webpage I can also embed short videos to further describe some of the topics. Further you can download the questions (and later the answers, top left of the screen) in a format that suits you (either pdf or epub) to view offline, or change the way this document appears for ease of reading. If you spot any typos or think there are any errors please let me know and I will do my best to fix them. Workshops for CH10009 The topics for LOILS each week are as follows: Week 1: General Q&amp;A Week 2: Rearranging equations, units and standard form Week 3: Logarithms and exponentials Week 4: Tables and graphs Week 5: Calculus - differentiation - the basics and the chain rule Week 6: Calculus - differentiation - the product rule and partial differentiation Week 7: Calculus - integration - the basics and definite integrals Week 8: Some more examples of integration and revision This ‘book’ will be updated weekly with workshop questions, answers will be provided and some answers will include ‘process’ as well as answer. Please contact me if you need help. I am using this format as it is an accessible format. Version history Some more video answers for workshop 1 embedded 11th October 2020.

Table 1.1: The seven base units from which all others are dervied. SI base unit symbol quantity symbol (dimension) quantity kilogram kg M mass metre m L length second s T time ampere A I electric current kelvin K Θ temperature mole mol N amount of substance candela cd J luminous intensity 1.1.2 SI Derived units Table 1.2: Some common SI derived units used in chemistry. symbol SI derived unit quantity SI base units other SI units Hz hertz frequency s-1 N newton force kg m s-2 Pa pascal pressure kg m-1 s-2 N m-2 J joule energy kg m2 s-2 N m W watt power kg m2 s-3 J s-1 C coulomb electrical charge A s V volt electrical potential kg m2 s-3 A-1 J C-1 F farad electrical capacitance kg-1 m-2 s4 A2 C V-1 Ω ohm electrical resistance kg m2 s-3 A-2 V A-1 S siemens electrical conductance kg-1 m-2 s3 A2 A V-1 or 1/Ω 1.1.3 Other units and conversion factors There are a number of non-SI base or derived units which are in common usage which are useful to know and be able to convert between. Table 1.3 contains a number of useful unit conversions. Table 1.3: The relationship between some other common units and the SI system. unit quantity SI equivalant torr (or mm Hg) pressure \\(\\frac{101325}{760}\\) Pa atm pressure 101325 Pa bar pressure 100000 Pa eV energy 1.602176634 × 10-19 J cal energy 4.184 J Å length 1 × 10-10 m There are myriad other units in use, either with historical or geographic preference, or just for niche purposes (where would we be without olympic swimming pools or London buses). Examples such as the mile, furlong or beard-second are all units of length. Further, the unit ºC is formally an SI derived unit. The temperature in Kelvin is: \\[\\begin{equation*} T (\\textrm{K}) = T (\\textrm{K}) + 273.15 \\end{equation*}\\] 1.1.4 SI prefixes and standard form In general lower case prefixes are used for negative powers and upper case prefixes are used for positive powers, however k (kilo) is an obvious exception to this rule. (Other exceptions are da (deca, 101) and h (hecto, 102)). Table 1.4: The more common SI prefixes used in chemistry. SI prefix SI prefix ‘name’ standard form multiplier y yocto 10-24 z zepto 10-21 a atto 10-18 f femto 10-15 p pico 10-12 n nano 10-9 μ micro 10-6 m milli 10-3 c centi 10-2 d deci 10-1 k kilo 103 1.2 Questions 1.2.1 Rearranging equations Answers for these questions are in Section 1.3.1. For each of the following rearrange to make the specified variable the subject of the equation. \\([A]= [A]_0 - kt\\), \\(t\\) \\(E = \\frac{1}{2}mv^2\\), \\(v\\) \\(F = \\frac{q_1 q_2}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon _0 r^2}\\), \\(r\\) \\(\\frac{1}{[A]}=\\frac{1}{[A]_0}+kt\\), \\([A]_0\\) \\(\\ln (x_A)=-\\frac{\\Delta H}{R}(\\frac{1}{T_1}-\\frac{1}{T_2})\\), \\(T_1\\) \\(K_a=\\frac{\\alpha ^2 c}{1- \\alpha}\\), \\(\\alpha\\) 1.2.2 Unit conversion questions Answers for these questions are in Section 1.3.2.
