# Week 5 {#ch:Workshop5}

## Preliminary infomation {#sec:Prelim5}

Some functions are more difficult to determine their 'rate of change' than those listed in Chapter \@ref(ch:Workshop4), and so we can use new 'rules' to help us determine this. This difficulty may arrise because the function is a 'compound' function (such as the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution), or because the function has more than one variable (the Master equation in thermodynamics has both pressure and temperature as active variables).

In this workshop we will recap the standard differentials previously studied, and expand on this so that we can determine, gradients, rates and turning points for more complicated functions.

A recap of standard differentials...

 \dfrac{A}{x^n} \equiv A x^{-n} & &-nA x^{-n-1} \\

\end{array}
\end{equation*}

Now we can apply these rules to more complicated functions.

### The Chain Rule {#subsec:chainrule}

If differentiating a function of a function we use the 'Chain Rule':

$\dfrac{\textrm{d}y}{\textrm{d}x}=\dfrac{\textrm{d}y}{\textrm{d}u} \times \dfrac{\textrm{d}u}{\textrm{d}x}$

When we use the term 'function of a function' we are referring to nested functions, these can be difficult to spot at first, but with practice we can identify part of our function to express as a variable $u$, and have a second function acting on $u$.

An example of a nested function can be a natural log. I have previously used one of our 'rules of logs' to show the differentiation of the function $y = \ln ax$ (Section \@ref(subsec:difflogs)), but we can use the chain rule to do the same thing.

:::thing
If $y = \ln {ax}$, let $u=ax$, so we can express our log as $y = \ln u$.

Applying the chain rule, we need to determine $\dfrac{\textrm{d}y}{\textrm{d}u}$ and $\dfrac{\textrm{d}u}{\textrm{d}x}$.

$y = \ln u$ then $\dfrac{\textrm{d}y}{\textrm{d}u} = \dfrac{1}{u}$.

$u=ax$ then $\dfrac{\textrm{d}u}{\textrm{d}x}=a$.

Applying the chain rule, then $\dfrac{\textrm{d}y}{\textrm{d}x}=\dfrac{1}{u} \times a$.

Substituting $u = ax$, then $\dfrac{\textrm{d}y}{\textrm{d}x}=\dfrac{1}{ax} \times a$, and cancelling the $a$s. 

$\dfrac{\textrm{d}y}{\textrm{d}x}=\dfrac{1}{x}$, the same result as in Section \@ref(subsec:difflogs).
:::

Another example of a nested function is $y=\cos x^2$, in this case we can say $u=x^2$, so our original function becomes $y=\cos u$.

If we now differentiate $y$ with respect to $u$, and $u$, with respect to $x$ we have all of the infomation we need to use the chain rule.

$\dfrac{\textrm{d}y}{\textrm{d}u} = -\sin u$ and $\dfrac{\textrm{d}u}{\textrm{d}x}=2x$.

Therefore $\dfrac{\textrm{d}y}{\textrm{d}x} = -\sin u \times 2x$, and so with a little bit of substitution for $u$ and tidying up:

$\dfrac{\textrm{d}y}{\textrm{d}x} = -2x\sin x^2$

### The Product Rule {#subsec:productrule}

If differentiate a function times a function we use the 'Product Rule', if :

\begin{equation*}
y= uv
\end{equation*}

...where $u$ and $v$ are different functions of $x$. The first derivative of this compound function may be found using the general differential form for products:

\begin{equation}
\textrm{d}(uv) = v\textrm{d}u + u\textrm{d}v
(\#eq:productrule)
\end{equation}

### Partial differentiation {#subsec:partial}

Any good scientist knows that you should only change one variable at a time to understand the effect it has on a system. This is exactly what partial differentiation does, although it recognises that there may be more than one variable in the system...

Partial differentiation uses a different notation to standard differentiation to denote there is more than one variable. Subscritps are used to denote variables which are kept constant.

If y is a function of both x and z, then we can differentiate with respect to either variable, in this case we treat the other variable as a constant and differentiate as we ever have. The notation for differentiating y with respect to z as x is kept constant would be:

\begin{equation*}
\left(\frac{\partial y}{\partial z}\right)_x
\end{equation*}

In some circumstances you may wish to differentiate a function first by one variable and then by another, the notation is this case is:

\begin{equation*}
\left(\frac{\partial^2 y}{\partial x \partial z}\right)
\end{equation*}

this is implying that the partial derivative of y with respect to x was determined first and then the partial derivate of that first derivative was determined with respect to z. It should not matter in which order you perform these functions, they should both yield the same answer.

:::warning
Since there is just one significant figure in the question the answers should only be reported to one significant figure.

This means that for the value of '80' we need to use standard form as any number we share is deemed to be significant.
